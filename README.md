# Trapdoor Knapsack Problem
Implementing an C++ super increasing knapsack to show the encryption and decryption of message
 This program demonstrates the concept of super-increasing knapsack of 8 private keys. User input is required.

 ### Compilation 
 
 ```
On Linux terminal:
g++ -std=c++11 knapsack.cpp -o knapsack
```
### Example of Program execution

```
User types in 8 inputs (2,7,11,21,42,89,180,354) for super increasing knapsack
Program calculates total sum of knapsack inputs and display

User key in modulus value that is larger than sum of knapsack (881)

User key in multiplier value that must be coprime to modulus value that is earlier given (588)

User is prompted to key in message to encrypt 

Program displays encypted message in bits 

Program displays decrypted message in bits and back into plaintext
